### Background and Overview 

I have an interest in data and baseball, I hope to work in an MLB organization as a software engineer in the future. MLB has a a deep history in statistics. I thought it would be interesting to see the different ways I can learn to display this data in a visually enticing way.

### Functionality & MVP


In `Name TBD`, users will be able to:

[ ] View data on Major League Baseball (MLB) Team Payroll
[ ] View data on which team has the best value per $ US Dollar.
[ ] View Data On MLB Player Salary
[ ] View How Valuable an Individual Player is to a Team

In addition, this project will include:

[ ] A way to compare player value against their salary
[ ] One or two differnt types of charts to display this data

### Wireframe
- in the repo

### API + Technology Explanation 

- My data will be in the form or csv files in order to have all the data in one place
- Potentially using and MLB API to pull data from
- Data will be sourced from FanGraphs and Baseball Prospectus
- I plan to learn and use the D3 library in order to display graphs

### Implementation Timeline 
- Day 1: Learn how to interface with the api's and learn how to import csv's to be read as data
- Day 2: Learn how to implement the D3 library in order to display graphs on the application
- Day 3: Learn how to incorporate the data from api/csv into the graphs
- Day 4: Learn how to dymanically repaint the graphs and begin styling with scss
- Day 5: Finish styling and fixing last minute bugs

### (Bonus Features) 
A nice bonus feature would be the ability to check the graphs for previous seasons with the toggle of a button
